#BigTube!

BigTube! is a very simple app, it simply takes a YouTube video address and embed it according the window viewport of the browser 
so instead of maximizing the video in full screen we can watch programming tutorials in a proper manner.

#Full scrren video is a mess ðŸ˜£

Full screen video simply makes the computer unusable, let me tell you my own use case.

Everyday I watch a lot of tutorials about programming and latest coding stuffs but then I simply make my computer unusable 
by making the YouTube video full screen to see what people (cool programmers) are typing!

It also occure problems while I need to switch to my own code editor and the YouTube plaer and vice-versa. ðŸ˜¤

So, here is a solution that is currently working for me âœŒ

Go to [BigTube Demo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rakibtg/BigTube/master/index.html) and copy/paste a YouTube link and hit enter. BOOM! 

![first step](https://github.com/rakibtg/BigTube/raw/master/1.png "Provide a YouTube link and hit enter")

![second step](https://github.com/rakibtg/BigTube/raw/master/2.png "Enjoy the video!")

That's better! ðŸ™Œ
